This repository contains KinCart’s enforceable build governance: how decisions become truth, how we prevent correctness/security drift (auth + RLS + RPC), and the gates we must pass before implementation steps. KinCart’s priority is reducing mental load and preserving emotional safety through shared intent visibility; if a suggestion conflicts with an invariant, the invariant wins.

This is not a product backlog or delivery tracker. KinCart is currently non-commercial R&D; architectural authority remains with the sole architect, and external participation is limited to peer review / collaborative learning with no milestones, deadlines, or IP transfer.
