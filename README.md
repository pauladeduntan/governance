# KinCart — governance (research)

This repository documents KinCart’s **research governance**: how decisions become truth, how constraints prevent drift, and how emotionally safe coordination remains protected under failure.

**Start here:** `START_HERE.md`

This is not a product backlog or delivery tracker. KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact; external participation is limited to peer review / collaborative learning with no milestones, deadlines, or IP transfer.

## What’s inside
- A decision register and decision records (what is committed vs merely suggested)
- Action gates (what must be true before changes are made)
- Conceptual consistency principles that prevent silent drift (described without implementation recipes)

Implementation details can be shared privately for supervisor review if needed.
