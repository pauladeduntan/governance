# KinCart — governance (research)

This repository documents KinCart’s **research governance**: how decisions become truth, how constraints prevent drift, and how emotionally safe coordination remains protected under failure.
## Status (research-only)

KinCart is a **non-commercial research artefact**. This repository documents research framing, design invariants, and prototype evidence. It is **not** a product launch, a service offering, or a commercial operation.

**Mechanics policy:** Implementation details that would enable cloning (schemas/RLS/RPC specifics, deploy steps, paste-ready backend scripts) are intentionally **not** published in public.

**Future pathway (hypothetical only):** Any future commercialization would require explicit conditions (institutional approval, legal/immigration compliance, ethics posture, and funding). Until those conditions are met, KinCart remains **research-only**.

**Start here:** `START_HERE.md`

This is not a product backlog or delivery tracker. KinCart is a non-commercial research artefact; external participation is limited to peer review / collaborative learning with no milestones, deadlines, or IP transfer.

## What’s inside
- A decision register and decision records (what is committed vs merely suggested)
- Action gates (what must be true before changes are made)
- Conceptual consistency principles that prevent silent drift (described without implementation recipes)

## What is intentionally not published
- Paste-ready implementation mechanics (schema/RLS/RPC specifics, operational scripts, deploy steps)
- “How to build KinCart” instructions

Implementation details can be shared privately for supervisor review if needed.
