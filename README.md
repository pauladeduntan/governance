KinCart Governance is the authoritative decision and boundary record for KinCart, a non-commercial research artefact exploring human-centred household coordination through reduced mental load, emotional safety, and shared intent. This repository defines invariants, rejected paths, and governance decisions; it is not a product backlog, delivery tracker, or contribution queue. All architectural and strategic authority remains with the sole architect; external participation is limited to peer review and collaborative learning without obligations, milestones, or IP transfer.
