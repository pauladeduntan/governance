# D014 — Item details are accessible from Activity

## Decision
Activity rows for Item events may open an "Item details" sheet.

This is the sanctioned way to:
- Read details/notes that don’t fit in a one-line preview.
- View Handoff tags and brief context without expanding the Activity row into a narrative.

## Rationale
Activity should remain scannable. Long notes must be readable without forcing the main UI into clutter or policing behaviour.

## Invariants Protected
- Visibility > reminders
- Emotional safety > optimisation

## Trade-offs
- One extra tap to see full detail
- Cleaner Activity feed and lower escalation risk

## Copy Guardrails
- Details are optional and brief.
- Prefer situational summaries over exact times.
