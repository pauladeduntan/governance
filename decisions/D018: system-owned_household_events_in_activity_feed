# D018 - System-owned Household Events in Activity Feed

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-18

## Decision

Activity may include a small set of system-owned Household events to reduce confusion and prevent misinterpretation during coordination breakdowns. These events are included for boundary clarity and comprehension, not for accountability.

Included system-owned events in the Activity feed:

- Household Name Updated
- Household Members Updated
- A Former Member No Longer Has Access

Excluded from the Activity feed as explicit event text:

- Member Left Household
- Member Removed

Instead, membership loss is represented only as:
- A Former Member No Longer Has Access

Where additional detail is needed to reduce ambiguity, it may be revealed on demand in a read-only context sheet. The feed remains minimal.

## Rationale

Without system-owned Household events, Members may misread state changes as interpersonal actions (“who changed this?”), increasing pressure and conflict risk. Minimal, neutral system-owned events preserve comprehension and reduce false attribution.

Using a single neutral phrase for membership loss avoids ambiguity and avoids the feed becoming a punitive or accusatory surface.

## Failure Modes Prevented

- Members misattribute system changes to another person, creating blame.
- Confusion during Household context switching or renaming causes wrong-household actions.
- Membership loss is framed as punishment or conflict evidence.
- Activity becomes a governance ledger rather than a calm record.

## Invariants Protected

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation.
- Visibility Over Reminders.
- System-owned language and identity display.
- Boundary integrity and exit safety treated as safety properties.
- Activity is a record, not a performance feed.

## Scope

Applies to:

- Activity feed event set and wording.
- Household rename and membership change visibility.
- Activity context sheets used to reduce ambiguity without adding policing affordances.

## Verification

To consider this decision implemented, verify that:

- The Activity feed includes only the allowed system-owned Household events.
- Membership loss never appears as “Member Left” or “Member Removed” in the feed.
- Any additional context is read-only and revealed on demand, without edit or escalation actions.
