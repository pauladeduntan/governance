## Decision

Activity may include a small set of system-owned Household events to reduce confusion and constrain misinterpretation during coordination breakdowns. These events exist for boundary clarity and comprehension, not for accountability.

Included system-owned events in the Activity feed:

- Household Name Updated
- Household Members Updated
- A Former Member No Longer Has Access

Excluded from the Activity feed as explicit event text:

- Member Left Household
- Member Removed

Instead, membership loss is represented only as:

- A Former Member No Longer Has Access

Where additional detail is needed to reduce ambiguity, it may be revealed on demand in a read-only context sheet. The feed remains minimal.

## Rationale

This decision constrains **visibility-to-enforcement drift** by keeping state-change visibility system-owned and low-detail, reducing false attribution (“who did this?”) without turning Activity into a governance ledger.

Using a single neutral phrase for membership loss avoids punitive framing and limits conflict evidence creation.

## Failure Modes Prevented

- Members misattribute system changes to another person, creating blame.
- Confusion during Household context switching or renaming contributes to wrong-Household actions.
- Membership loss is framed as punishment or conflict evidence.
- Activity becomes a governance ledger rather than a calm record.

## Invariants Protected

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation
- Visibility Over Reminders
- System-owned language and identity display
- Boundary integrity and exit safety treated as safety properties
- Activity is a record, not a performance feed

## Scope

Applies to:

- Activity feed event set and wording
- Household rename and membership change visibility
- Activity context sheets used to reduce ambiguity without adding policing affordances

## Verification

To consider this decision implemented, verify that:

- The Activity feed includes only the allowed system-owned Household events.
- Membership loss never appears as “Member Left” or “Member Removed” in the feed.
- Any additional context is read-only and revealed on demand, without edit or escalation actions.

## Review and Supersession

This decision can only be changed via a new decision entry:
