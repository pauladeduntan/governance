# D019 - Member Exit Feed Wording is System-Owned

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-01-18

## Decision

When membership ends for any reason (leave or removal), the Activity feed must not display an event that implies blame, punishment, or an interpersonal action.

The feed must use the single neutral system-owned phrase:

- A Former Member No Longer Has Access

This event is system-owned and non-attributed by default.

Any context needed for comprehension may be shown on demand in a read-only context sheet, but must not reveal persistent identity history after membership ends. If identity is shown in any context view, it must dynamically re-render to “Former Member” by default after membership ends.

## Rationale

Membership transitions are socially sensitive. Explicit “left” versus “removed” wording can be weaponized in conflict and can increase emotional harm. A single neutral system-owned phrase preserves comprehension while reducing punitive interpretation.

This also supports exit safety by preventing persistent identity exposure and preventing Activity from becoming a dispute record.

## Failure Modes Prevented

- Feed content becomes conflict evidence (“you removed me”).
- Users feel surveilled or punished through wording choices.
- Identity exposure persists after membership ends through historical entries.
- Exit becomes emotionally unsafe due to public attribution.

## Invariants Protected

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation.
- Visibility Over Reminders.
- System-owned language and identity display.
- Exit safety.
- Activity is a calm record, not an accountability surface.

## Scope

Applies to:

- Activity feed wording for membership end.
- Any Activity context sheet that clarifies membership end.
- Any identity rendering in historical Activity views.

## Verification

To consider this decision implemented, verify that:

- The Activity feed displays only “A Former Member No Longer Has Access” for membership end.
- The event is not attributed to any actor in the feed.
- Context details are read-only and minimal.
- Identity is dynamically redacted to “Former Member” by default after membership ends across historical entries and context sheets.
