# D017 - Activity Anti-amplification Guardrails

## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Decision

Activity must remain a calm, read-only record of Shared Cart and selected system-owned Household events. It must not support any mechanics that enable per-person comparison, ranking, or “performance feed” interpretation.

The following are explicitly disallowed:

- Per-person views (for example, “Paul’s Activity”).
- Counts or totals by person (including hearts, completions, additions, or any other action count).
- Sorting, grouping, filtering, or searching by person.
- Badges, streaks, leaderboards, or contribution summaries.
- Export-like summaries or shareable “who did what” rollups.

Names may appear for active Members as attribution only, but attribution must not be amplified into metrics or per-person representations.

## Rationale

The primary drift risk in household coordination systems is that a visibility surface becomes an accountability surface. Even without explicit scoring, small affordances (filters, counts, sorting) can turn Activity into monitoring and comparison.

This decision blocks surveillance interpretation and reduces conflict-evidence creation, especially during High-Stakes Handoff Item moments where blame risk is elevated.

## Failure Modes Prevented

- Activity becomes a performance feed even without explicit scoring.
- Household conflict escalates through “evidence” derived from per-person views or totals.
- Participants interpret the system as judging or measuring contributions.
- High-Stakes Handoff Items trigger compliance policing via rollups.

## Invariants Protected

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation.
- Visibility Over Reminders.
- Shared intent visible; no contribution scoring, fairness evaluation, or per-person judgement.
- System-owned language and identity display.

## Scope

Applies to:

- Activity feed.
- Any Activity-adjacent views (including context sheets).
- Any UI, export, or reporting affordance that could present per-person representations.

## Verification

To consider this decision implemented, verify that:

- No per-person filters, grouping, sorting, or counts exist in Activity or any related view.
- No badges, streaks, leaderboards, or contribution summaries are present.
- Any attribution names shown for active Members do not enable per-person representations elsewhere.
