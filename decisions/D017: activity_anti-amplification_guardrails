## Decision

Activity remains a calm, read-only record of Shared Cart actions and selected system-owned Household events. It must not support mechanics that enable per-person comparison, ranking, or “performance feed” interpretation.

Explicitly disallowed:

- Per-person views (for example, “Paul’s Activity”).
- Counts or totals by person (including Hearts, completions, additions, or any other action count).
- Sorting, grouping, filtering, or searching by person.
- Badges, streaks, leaderboards, or contribution summaries.
- Export-like summaries or shareable “who did what” rollups.

Names may appear for active Members as attribution only, but attribution must not be amplified into metrics or per-person representations.

## Rationale

The primary drift risk is **visibility-to-enforcement drift**: a visibility surface becomes an accountability surface. Even without explicit scoring, affordances such as filters, counts, or sorting can turn Activity into monitoring and comparison.

This decision constrains surveillance interpretation and constrains conflict evidence creation, especially during High-Stakes Handoff Item moments where blame risk is elevated.

## Failure Modes Prevented

- Activity becomes a performance feed even without explicit scoring.
- Household conflict escalates through “evidence” derived from per-person views or totals.
- Participants interpret the system as judging or measuring contributions.
- High-Stakes Handoff Items trigger compliance policing via rollups.

## Invariants Protected

- Emotional Safety Over Optimisation
- Visibility Over Reminders
- Shared intent visible; no contribution scoring, fairness evaluation, or per-person judgement
- System-owned language and identity display

## Scope

Applies to:

- Activity feed
- Any Activity-adjacent views (including context sheets)
- Any UI, export, or reporting affordance that could present per-person representations

## Verification

To consider this decision implemented, verify that:

- No per-person filters, grouping, sorting, searching-by-person, or counts exist in Activity or any related view.
- No badges, streaks, leaderboards, or contribution summaries are present.
- Any attribution names shown for active Members do not enable per-person representations elsewhere.

## Review and Supersession

This decision can only be changed via a new decision entry:
