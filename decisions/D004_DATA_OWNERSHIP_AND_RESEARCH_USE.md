# D004 — Data Ownership, Research Use, and Ethical Boundaries

## Status
Accepted — Non-negotiable

## Context
KinCart is being developed as a non-commercial research artefact exploring household coordination, mental load, and emotional safety. The project may later inform academic research (including a potential PhD) and future product development, but is not currently a commercial venture.

Given:
- UK Skilled Worker visa constraints
- A long-term Global Talent (Exceptional Promise) goal
- The possibility of academic research outputs
- The involvement of collaborators strictly as peer reviewers

It is critical to explicitly define data ownership, usage boundaries, and ethical posture to prevent ambiguity or future misrepresentation.

## Decision

1. **Data Ownership**
   - All intellectual property, system design, schemas, data models, and generated artefacts are solely owned by the KinCart founder.
   - Any data generated within KinCart during R&D is controlled by the founder as part of the research artefact.
   - No collaborator, reviewer, or external contributor acquires ownership, licensing rights, or derivative claims.

2. **Nature of Data Collected**
   - KinCart intentionally avoids collecting sensitive personal data.
   - No financial transaction data, precise location data, health data, or legally sensitive identifiers are collected.
   - Data is limited to coordination artefacts (e.g. items, actions, timestamps, anonymised behavioural signals).

3. **Research Use**
   - KinCart may be referenced publicly and academically as a **research artefact**, not a startup.
   - Aggregated, anonymised insights may be used for academic writing, presentations, or a future PhD application.
   - No user-identifiable data will be published or used in research outputs.
   - Any future academic use will adhere to institutional ethics requirements if applicable.

4. **Non-Commercial Positioning**
   - KinCart is currently non-commercial R&D.
   - No revenue generation, monetisation experiments, or commercial contracts are undertaken at this stage.
   - Any future transition to a commercial product would require an explicit governance decision.

5. **Collaborator Boundary**
   - Collaborators participate solely as peer reviewers or for collaborative learning.
   - They do not generate production work, are not subject to deadlines, and are not evaluated on output.
   - Their contributions do not affect data ownership or research rights.

## Consequences

- Governance is now complete for pre-implementation.
- Backend and frontend implementation can proceed without IP, ethics, or visa-risk ambiguity.
- Public communication can safely frame KinCart as research-led.
- Future academic or commercial decisions must explicitly reference this decision if they diverge.
