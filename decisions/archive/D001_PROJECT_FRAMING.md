# D001 — Project Framing: Research-led, Non-Commercial Artefact

## Status
Accepted (active)

## Decision
KinCart is framed publicly and operationally as a research-led, non-commercial R&D artefact exploring household coordination systems focused on mental load reduction, emotional safety, and shared intent.

Until an explicit later decision changes this framing:
- No trading, revenue, paid pilots, or commercial “go-to-market” activity.
- Public language avoids “startup”, “growth”, “customers”, “pricing”, “sales”, or “traction”.
- The primary outputs are research artefacts and implementation artefacts (schema, prototypes, experiments).

## Rationale
This framing:
- Preserves UK Skilled Worker visa compliance by keeping work strictly non-commercial and outside contracted hours.
- Supports a Global Talent Visa (Exceptional Promise) leadership narrative through research-led system design.
- Avoids misleading public claims while the product is still experimental.
- Keeps the product checksum intact: “Making every day lighter, together.”

## Boundaries
### Allowed
- Publishing design rationales, invariants, constraints, and architecture decisions.
- Sharing low-fidelity wireframes and non-sensitive prototypes.
- Building and testing MVP functionality privately.
- Collecting informal qualitative feedback without commercial intent.

### Not allowed
- Selling access, taking payments, paid subscriptions, or revenue experiments.
- Public recruitment that implies employment, deliverables, deadlines, or “hiring”.
- Claims of market availability, performance guarantees, or “production readiness”.

## Ownership and Collaboration Model
- Sole decision maker and architect: the project direction, architecture, and IP remain with the founder.
- Collaborators (UI/UX, QA) participate only as peer review and collaborative learning.
- No milestones, deadlines, productivity requirements, or employment-like expectations.
- No transfer of IP to collaborators.

## Implications
- Public positioning: “research artefact” language is default.
- Repo structure: governance decisions act as source of truth over chat history.
- Future funding: any commercial reframing requires a new decision file that explicitly supersedes this one.

## Review / Supersession
This decision can only be changed via a new decision entry:
- D00X — Project Framing Update (supersedes D001)
