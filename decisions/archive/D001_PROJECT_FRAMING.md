# D001 - Project Framing: Research-Led, Non-Commercial Artefact

## Status

Accepted (Active)

## Decision

KinCart is framed publicly and in research practice as a research-led, non-commercial artefact exploring household coordination systems focused on mental load reduction, emotional safety, and shared intent.

Until an explicit later decision changes this framing:

- No trading, revenue, paid pilots, or commercial go-to-market activity.
- Public language avoids startup positioning and commercial vocabulary such as growth, customers, pricing, sales, traction, or product launch framing.
- Public outputs are research materials and public-safe governance artefacts (principles, constraints, failure modes, and behavior-level narratives), not implementation recipes.

## Rationale

This framing:

- Preserves research integrity by preventing premature commercialization claims while the artefact remains exploratory.
- Reduces misclassification risk by keeping the project legible as a research probe rather than a product or service.
- Protects participant safety and emotional safety goals by avoiding pressure-driven incentives that encourage enforcement or surveillance drift.
- Keeps the checksum intact: “Making every day lighter, together.”

## Boundaries

### Allowed

- Publishing design rationales, invariants, constraints, and public-safe governance decisions.
- Sharing non-sensitive prototypes and research materials suitable for interpretive study.
- Building and testing the current research prototype privately.
- Collecting informal qualitative feedback without commercial intent and without coercive framing.

### Not Allowed

- Selling access, taking payments, paid subscriptions, or revenue experiments.
- Public recruitment that implies employment, deliverables, deadlines, or hiring.
- Claims of market availability, performance guarantees, production readiness, or operational service delivery.

## Ownership and Collaboration Model

- Sole decision maker and architect: project direction, architecture decisions, and IP remain with the founder.
- Collaborators (UI/UX, QA) participate only as peer review and collaborative learning.
- No milestones, deadlines, productivity requirements, or employment-like expectations.
- No transfer of IP to collaborators.

## Implications

- Public positioning: “research artefact” language is the default.
- Repo discipline: governance decisions are the source of truth over informal suggestions or chat history.
- Any reframing toward commercial or service delivery posture requires a new decision file that explicitly supersedes this one.

## Review and Supersession

This decision can only be changed via a new decision entry:
