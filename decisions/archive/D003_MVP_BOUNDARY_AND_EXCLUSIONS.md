# D003 - Current Research Prototype Boundary and Explicit Exclusions

## Status

Accepted (Active)

## Purpose

This decision defines the explicit boundary of the current KinCart research prototype. Anything not listed as in scope is intentionally excluded, even if it appears technically simple or commonly expected.

This protects focus, emotional safety, and research integrity.

## Current Research Prototype Scope (Inclusions)

The current research prototype includes only:

### 1) Household Context Resolution

- Members can belong to one or more Households.
- A Household is selected explicitly before viewing Shared Cart or Activity.
- No hierarchy, roles, or permissions beyond active membership.

### 2) Shared Cart (Single Default Cart)

- A Household has a single Shared Cart (Default Cart).
- The Shared Cart contains Items representing shared intent.
- The Shared Cart is a coordination surface, not a project plan.

### 3) Items as Soft State

- Items can be added by any Member.
- Items can be completed by any Member.
- Complete Item hides Items without deleting them.
- Items can be shown again without friction (reversible).

### 4) Ambient Activity Visibility

- The system records a neutral Activity record of list actions (Added, Completed, Hid, Showed Again).
- Activity is calm, read-only, and non-evaluative.
- Activity is not a performance feed and must not become a notification centre.

### 5) Guest and Optional Sign-in

- Members may explore as guests.
- Sign-in is optional and framed as Save Progress.
- Sign-in enables persistence, not privilege.

### 6) Hearts (Constrained Gratitude)

- Hearts, if present, are item-scoped and must not function as a feed mechanic.
- Hearts must not appear as counts or reactions in Activity.

## Explicit Exclusions (Non-Negotiable For The Current Research Prototype)

The current research prototype will not include:

### A) Assignment and Ownership

- No Item assignment to individuals.
- No “who is responsible” designation.
- No acceptance, claiming, or delegation flows.

### B) Reminders and Nudging

- No notifications, reminders, or follow-ups.
- No “you haven’t done this” or “don’t forget” mechanics.

### C) Fairness or Contribution Metrics

- No tracking of who did more or less.
- No statistics, charts, or summaries of contribution.
- No gamification or streaks.

### D) Social Feedback in Activity or Feed Form

- No reactions in Activity.
- No reaction counts in Activity.
- No comments or discussion threads in Activity.

### E) Event Orchestration

- No timelines, deadlines, or schedules.
- No event-specific cart surfaces.
- Event examples may exist only as illustrative concepts for research discussion.

### F) Administrative Controls

- No admin dashboards.
- No moderation, approvals, or controls.
- No audit or compliance views.

## Rationale

Each excluded category introduces one or more of the following costs:

- Surveillance risk
- Emotional pressure
- Implicit judgement
- Increased mental load

These costs outweigh short-term completeness gains for the current research prototype.

## Implications

- Requests outside this boundary are deferred.
- “Easy to add later” is not a justification for inclusion.
- Success is assessed by clarity and calm, not completeness.

## Review and Supersession

This decision may only be changed by a new entry:
