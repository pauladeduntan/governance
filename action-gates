# Action Gates (Non-negotiable)

These gates exist to prevent thrash, protect emotional safety, and avoid correctness/security rework.

## Gate A — Spec Integrity
- Blueprint is frozen and linked as authoritative.
- Invariants + Domain Language are linked and treated as constraints.

## Gate B — Security Contract
- Membership checks are enforced consistently in:
  1) RLS policies
  2) RPC authorization
  3) Client routing/context
- No SECURITY DEFINER RPC accepts identifiers without membership verification.

## Gate C — Implementation Readiness
Before any build step, answer:
1) What is the user-facing behaviour?
2) What is the failure mode if it breaks?
3) What invariant does it protect?

If you can’t answer all three, stop and make a decision entry or open question.

## Gate D — Public Sharing Hygiene
Anything public must avoid:
- Sensitive schema keys/secrets
- Security-relevant bypass details
- Data collection claims not in the blueprint
