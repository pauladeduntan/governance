# Action Gates (Non-Negotiable)

These gates exist to prevent thrash, protect emotional safety, and avoid correctness and security rework.

## Gate A: Spec Integrity

- Blueprint is treated as authoritative and linked.
- Invariants (Locked) and Domain Language (Locked) are treated as constraints, not suggestions.

## Gate B: Access Boundary Integrity

- Household boundary rules must be enforced consistently across the system.
- No privileged change is accepted unless the system verifies that the current Member is valid for the active Household boundary.
- No internal shortcut may bypass boundary integrity, exit safety, or system-owned identity defaults.

## Gate C: Change Readiness

Before any change is accepted, answer:

1) What is the user-facing behaviour?
2) What is the failure mode if it breaks?
3) What invariant does it protect?

If you cannot answer all three, stop and create a Decision Record or an Open Question.

## Gate D: Public Sharing Hygiene

Anything public must avoid:

- Secrets, credentials, or any security-sensitive internals.
- Security-relevant bypass details or enforcement mechanisms.
- Data collection or logging claims that are not already documented in the Blueprint.
- Copy and paste build recipes that enable cloning.
