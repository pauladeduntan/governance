# KinCart - Decision Register

This file indexes all non-reversible or identity-defining decisions made in the KinCart project.

Each decision:

- Has a unique ID, title, date, and notes
- Is recorded in its own file
- Explains why the decision was made
- Is treated as stable unless explicitly superseded

## Decision Storage Rule

A decision may be filed under `./archived/` for repository hygiene, but archive location does not change binding status. A decision stops being binding only when a later Decision Record explicitly supersedes it.
